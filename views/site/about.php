            <h5>How many links can be stored on this site?</h5>

            <p>
                - I used auto-growing algorithm for shortening so it's UNLIMITED!<br>
                P.S: Of course when database will get very huge size I will take action
            </p>

            <h5>Why is it free?</h5>

            <p>
                - It's built on free libraries so if I get it for free I have to take it for free ;)
            </p>

            <h5>Why there are not any ads?</h5>

            <p>
                - I have already thought about it. Maybe I will add it in the future but now it's not necessary because
                I have free droplet on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=ceacac516a96">Digital Ocean</a>
                for one year. I will be glad if you register on that site by my link.
